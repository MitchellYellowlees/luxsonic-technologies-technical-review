# Luxsonic Technologies Technical Review

This project is a website that allows users to login securely to access a dashboard, create records/entries that are submitted to a database using a web form, and be able to export those entries to a file that can be stored locally on a device.

## Starting the Backend
**Important:** The backend will not run if you do not have the '.env' file within the backend folder. The '.env' file is not pushed to the repo due to it's sensitive config info. If you require access to the .env file please contact Mitchell. 

To start the backend, cd into the backend folder and install the npm modules using these commands:
'npm install express'
'npm install cors'
'npm install mongoose'
'npm install dotenv'S
Then run the application with:
'node server'
Finally open your preferred browser and go to http://localhost:5000
